    <p> My name is Cintia. I am originally from Mexico... but I have been residing in the United States for most of my life. I have been dreams. One of them,
        may at the moment the most important is become a full stack developer. I love traveling and trying new food. But above all, I have a passion for helping others. 
        When I am of service to others I am happy. </p>
